# [Note] How to read Flame Graphs

## What is Flame Graphs?

[CPU Flame Graph](https://www.brendangregg.com/FlameGraphs/cpu-mysql-updated.svg)

Flame graphs are a visualization of hierarchical data, created to visualize stack traces of profiled software so that the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately.

Flame graphs were first introduced in 2013 by Brendan Gregg, a performance analysis expert and author.They can be generated by the open source program on  github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph.

Flame graphs have become a widely adopted method for performance analysis, as they provide a clear and intuitive representation of complex data. By displaying the hierarchical relationship between function calls and their resource consumption, flame graphs facilitate the identification of performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities in various systems, including CPU, memory, and I/O subsystems. This innovative approach has significantly impacted the field of software performance engineering, making it easier for developers to optimize and fine-tune their applications.

### Features
- timed sampling-based -> reduce overhead
- reorder samples -> maximize frame merging -> more readable
- a warm color palette -> flame graphs
- profiling software performance
- display call stack
